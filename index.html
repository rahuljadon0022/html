    <!-- lazy loading in html is a technique that delays the loading of certain part of a web page like images,until they are needed
     this is different from eager loading which loads everything at once 
     lazy loading can improve web performance by:
     reducing page load times
     conserving bandwidth
     conserving system resouces
     to lazy load images in html ,you can use the loading attribute on an img element the possible values for the loading attribute are 
     "eager" and "lazy".Eager is the default behaviour which tells the browser to load images as soon as the img element  -->
